        <h2 class="p1">This 10hr War is a gathering of thousands of players that fight each other at one time for special rewards only availiable during the 10 Hour War. <br> Here is what it looked like towards the center of the chaos.
            All players from both Horde and Alliance waiting untill 11:00 PM for the strike of the gong by the Scarab Lords. </h2>

        <h2 class="p2">Out of the thousands, about 15 or less chose to embark on the journey to become a "Scarab Lord" which required 3 weeks of work with you and 40 of your guildies pulling all nighters,
           most playing 6-8 hours/day to help their guild's Scarab Lord. <br><br> What are the perks you ask? Well along with getting cool gear, allows you to get a mount that only you can ride
            that no one else can obtain besides the Scarab Lords. </h3>

        <h2 class="p3">I unfortunately did not get Scarab Lord so I did not get the bug mount. BUT recently I did get something almost as good.
          The rarest mount in the game: the Swift Zullian Tiger (0.9% drop rate). <br> Along with having full best in slot gear/weapons I like to think I look pretty cool right now. </h3>
